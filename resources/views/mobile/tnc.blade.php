                                <li>Collusion occurs when two or more customers attempt to gain an unfair advantage, over other players, by sharing knowledge

                                    account may be terminated immediately if You attempt to collude, or actually collude with any other player (s).</li>
                                <li>Where possible, registered complaints will be investigated against&nbsp;any&nbsp;players suspected of collusion.

                                <li>For the avoidance of doubt, collusion includes both hard or direct collusion and soft collusion, i.e. where a player
                                    acts differently against different opponents within the same game because of external influence.</li>

                                    goes against our terms as we regard it as putting other players at a disadvantage.</li>
